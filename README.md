# A Trip to Sunset Camp in WebVR
In this 3D AFrame project, I made a summer camp 3-D environment. 
Originally, when designing the sky, I could not find any assets that blended well in 360 or any good searches of 360 images that were sunsets, 
so I decided to use Photoshop and blend the ends of the photos together so the edge weren't harsh in rendering as an Aframe texture. 

I thought to follow a Minecraft-like building blocks functionality would add some fun interacrion, so I added color-changing dodecahedrons that could 
emulate a sort of "do it yourself painting and coloring" of the world since the initial 2D images I took inspiration from were paintings. 

In addition, I liked the use of warm lighting in both paintings, and wanted two suns to emit a pink and orange hue to make 
the sunset haze real as the pass through the scene. Lastly, I decided to add in a fire-pit and logs, since the world I built had a comfy forest and it fit the scene as I was 
experimenting on the shapes, textures, animations, and particle systems.

## Experiencing loading issues?

The graphic assets used in this three.js project take a long time to load. IF you `git clone` this repo and view the `index.html` file in Live Server, 
you can view the Sunset Summer Camp on your local files.
